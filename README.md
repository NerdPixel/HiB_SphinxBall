# Biased Sphinx-Ball

## How to build the artifact 
1. Get the following technical equiptment: 
2. Get your laser cutting file from here: https://de.makercase.com/ (we choosed the polygonbox with 14,6 cm diameter/high and 6mm thickness 
3. Download the file, open it in a vector graphic programm ( at worst, even powerpoint works.) Add there holes for: speaker, micorofon, powersupply, display. To do this, take the measurements on the units beforehand. 
4. For a nice look, add a name logo and graphics as you like. 
5. Do the cutting (we worked with a laser cutting machine) 
6. Put the different parts together. Glue them together. (we used wood glue). Don't glue the last part. 
7. For some technical parts, you may have to do some soldering before you can install them. (Watch this, to know how: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rmErwU5E-k ) 
8. Connect the Display, the gyrosensor, the speaker and the microphone with your raspery-pi and put all of it, into the sphinxmodel. 
9. Close the model with the last part. 
10. Voila!
